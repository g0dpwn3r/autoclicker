## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip package manager

### Quick Install

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-autoclicker.git
   cd python-autoclicker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r Requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Alternative Installation (Standalone Executable)

For Windows users, you can use the provided executable:
- Download `AutoClicker.exe` from the releases
- Run the executable directly (no Python installation required)

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Launch the Application**
   - Run `python main.py` or execute `AutoClicker.exe`

2. **Configure Settings**
   - Set move time range (seconds)
   - Set click time range (seconds)
   - Adjust radius and angle for randomization
   - Select desired easing modes

3. **Select Target Application**
   - Click "Select key:" to choose your hotkey
   - Click "Start Recording" to choose the target window

4. **Record Actions**
   - Press your hotkey to start recording
   - Click on the target application to record positions
   - Press the hotkey again to stop recording

5. **Playback**
   - The autoclicker will automatically replay the recorded sequence
   - Use the console to monitor progress

### Configuration Options

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Move Time** | Time range for mouse movements (seconds) | 2.0 - 5.0 |
| **Click Time** | Time range between clicks (seconds) | 0.0 - 5.0 |
| **Radius** | Randomization radius around click points | 5 pixels |
| **Angle** | Angle range for randomization | 360¬∞ |
| **Timeout** | Delay between action sequences | 2.0 seconds |

### Easing Modes

Choose from these mouse movement curves:
- `easeInQuad` - Accelerating movement
- `easeOutQuad` - Decelerating movement
- `easeInOutQuad` - Accelerate then decelerate
- `easeOutQuart` - Sharp deceleration
- `easeInOutQuart` - Smooth acceleration/deceleration
- `easeInBack` - Bounce-back effect

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The application uses a `config.ini` file to store settings:

```ini
[Mouse]
modelist = easeInQuad easeOutQuad easeInOutQuad easeOutQuart easeInOutQuart easeInQuad easeInBack
startmove = 2.0
endmove = 5.0
startclick = 0.0
endclick = 5.0
radius = 5
angle = 360
timeout = 2.0

[key]
keybind = Key.space
```

### Configuration Parameters

- **modelist**: Space-separated list of easing functions
- **startmove/endmove**: Min/max time for mouse movements
- **startclick/endclick**: Min/max time between clicks
- **radius**: Pixel radius for position randomization
- **angle**: Degree range for angle randomization
- **timeout**: Seconds to wait between sequences
- **keybind**: Keyboard key for start/stop recording
